Prerequisite: Install Python based on your OS

Install with following command

pip install -U selenium
And use this module in your code

from selenium import webdriver
You can also use many of the following as required

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException
Here is an updated answer
I would recommend you to run script without IDE... Here is my approach

USE IDE to find xpath of object / element
And use find_element_by_xpath().click()
An example below shows login page automation

#ScriptName : Login.py
#---------------------
from selenium import webdriver

#Following are optional required
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException

baseurl = "http://www.mywebsite.com/login.php"
username = "admin"
password = "admin"

xpaths = { 'usernameTxtBox' : "//input[@name='username']",
           'passwordTxtBox' : "//input[@name='password']",
           'submitButton' :   "//input[@name='login']"
         }

mydriver = webdriver.Firefox()
mydriver.get(baseurl)
mydriver.maximize_window()

#Clear Username TextBox if already allowed "Remember Me" 
mydriver.find_element_by_xpath(xpaths['usernameTxtBox']).clear()

#Write Username in Username TextBox
mydriver.find_element_by_xpath(xpaths['usernameTxtBox']).send_keys(username)

#Clear Password TextBox if already allowed "Remember Me" 
mydriver.find_element_by_xpath(xpaths['passwordTxtBox']).clear()

#Write Password in password TextBox
mydriver.find_element_by_xpath(xpaths['passwordTxtBox']).send_keys(password)

#Click Login button
mydriver.find_element_by_xpath(xpaths['submitButton']).click()
There is an another way that you can find xpath of any object -

Install Firebug and Firepath addons in firefox
Open URL in Firefox
Press F12 to open Firepath developer instance
Select Firepath in below browser pane and chose select by "xpath"
Move cursor of the mouse to element on webpage
in the xpath textbox you will get xpath of an object/element.
Copy Paste xpath to the script.
Run script - python Login.py

You can also use css_selector instead of xpath. Firpath will also capture css_selector if tou move cursor to the object. You will have to use then - find_element_by_css_selector(css_selector)
