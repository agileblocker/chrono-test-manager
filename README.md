# Chrono Test Manager

Chrono Test Manager is a Python automation testing program for sleep-deprived, coffee-fueled software testers, test engineers, and QAs from all walks of life.

# Dependencies

Chrono Test Manager utilizes the following modules (all are already installed in the virtual environment):
- Selenium v.3.12.0
- Six v.1.11.0
- wxPython v.4.0.1

# Example Usage

Chrono Test Manager functions as an all-in-one testing hub for automation test efforts in Python. Currently it supports the following:
- Run/execute automated test cases written in Python/Selenium (.py) right from the application
- Edit test cases by launching .py test case file in the user's default file editor
- Provide a central starting location for test cases (directory is fully able to be navigated)
- Import/move test cases to this central location for faster future use
- Quickview test cases in simple modal window without calling an external text editor (read-only)
- Display test status and pass/fail results in dedicated window
- Save test results for printing/documenting test efforts

# Future Features
- Run/execute automated test suites (clusters of tests) at once
- Integration of JIRA Zephyr API to push up pass/fail results
- Set filetype preferences/extend usability beyond .py files
